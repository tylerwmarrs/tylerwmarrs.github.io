    "Last year my wife and I had a child, Garen Jay Marrs. Finding a name for him was an interesting task due to my wife having difficulties in picking names. Our first pet together, a cat, did not have a name for around 2 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "I spent quite a bit of time researching different apps available, but they did not seem to do what I wanted. Generally the apps only offered going through a list of names and liking or disliking them. As a data scientist, I was hoping to find an app that would suggest names as you provided feedback on which names you like and dislike. None of the apps that I reviewed had this capability so I decided to create my own. \n",
    "\n",
    "This post is the starting point of a short blog series that describes how I created my ideal baby naming application. It will cover both high and low level details of how it works and my reasoning behind the functionality. At the end of this blog series, the application will be freely available."
