        <p>Tyler Marrs started his software career at the young age of 12 years old. As he became aware of software development as a career, he obtained a Bachelor’s of Science degree from Missouri Western State University in Computer Information Systems (2011). Furthermore, he obtained a Master’s of Science degree in Software Engineering from the University of Maryland University College (2015). Initially Tyler was unable to find a business domain that interested him. He worked within several industries; philanthropy, advertising and logistics to name a few. Finally, he found a passion for bioinformatics by accident. His wife always had an interest in the field which led him to applying for a job posting within the field to see if he could get anywhere and he did. The technical challenges within the field are never ending and knowing that this work can benefit people within the medical field is very rewarding to him. Tyler currently works for Children’s Mercy Hospital within the genome center where he creates software tools that allow analysts to analyze next-generation sequence data. Essentially, the analysts look for genetic diseases within children to make a diagnosis. As his interest in bioinformatics became deeper and deeper, Tyler decided that he must pursue a PhD in this field.</p>
