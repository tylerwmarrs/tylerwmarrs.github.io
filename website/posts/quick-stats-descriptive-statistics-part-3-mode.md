	Introduction
</h2>

<p>
	In this quick post covering descriptive statistics we will cover the mode. The mode describes the frequency of values within a given data set.

<h2>
	Mode
</h2>

<p>
	The mode is one of the easiest descriptive statistics to understand. It simply provides the value(s) that occur(s)Â most frequently. In most cases it is not very informative to identify a single value that occurs frequently, however it is useful to find the number of occurences for many values. To do this we can make use of a histogram to display the data.
</p>

<p>
	Lets generate 1,000 numbers in the range of 1 to 20 and visualize it. The code to do this in R follows:
</p>

```r
data &lt;- sample(1:20, 1000, replace=T)
hist(data, main="Random Values 1 to 20")
```

<p>
	In the code sample above we generated the numbers and created a histogram of the data. A histogram, shown below, displays the number of occurrences for each value observed in our data set.

<h2>
	R
</h2>

<p>
	Unfortunately, there is not a single function to obtain the mode of a given data set. However, we can create a table for the number of occurrences or visualize the data with a histogram.
</p>

```r
data &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
table(data)
```

<h2>
	Python
</h2>

<p>
	In the Scipy module we can obtain the mode only.
</p>

```python
from scipy import stats
data = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
stats.mode(data)
```

<p>
	We can also use Scipy to reproduce a frequency table.
</p>

```python
from scipy import stats
data = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
stats.itemfreq(data)
```

<h2>
	Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
	The mode is one of the most under used descriptive values of a data set. It simply provides you with what value occurs most frequently. In some instances it might be nice to know, but less useful than the median or mean. R does not provide a built in method for finding the mode by itself, however Python's Scipy module provides both frequencys of all values or simply the mode.
